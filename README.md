Reliably open and lock files
============================

This crates provides a way to reliably open and lock a file, for example
for opening lock files, PID files, spool files, mailboxes and other kinds
of files which are used for synchronisation between processes.

The `OpenAndLock` trait implements the algorithm of the
[`flopen`][] function available on BSD systems. It is roughly equivalent
to opening a file and calling [`flock`][] with an `operation` argument
set to `LOCK_EX`, but it also attempts to detect and handle races between
opening or creating the file and locking it.

The trait provides two implementations, a blocking and a non-blocking one.

The `open_and_lock()` method waits until the file can be locked, so unless
an unrelated I/O error occurs, it will eventually succeed once the file has
been released if itâ€™s been held by a different process.

The `try_open_and_lock()` method returns an error immediately when the file
cannot be locked, allowing the called to handle it and retry if necessary.

Both methods retry automatically when a race condition occurs and a file
gets deleted or recreated directly after the lock has been acquired.

This trait extends `OpenOptions`, so it can be used the following way:
```
let file = OpenOptions::new()
    .read(true)
    .write(true)
    .create(true)
    .open_and_lock("/path/to/file")?;
```

At the moment, this crate supports UNIX-like platforms only.

/// This trait provides a way to reliably open and lock a file
///
/// `OpenAndLock` trait provides methods implementing the algorithm of the
/// [`flopen`][] function available on BSD systems. It is roughly equivalent
/// to opening a file and calling [`flock`][] with an `operation` argument
/// set to `LOCK_EX`, but it also attempts to detect and handle races between
/// opening or creating the file and locking it. This makes it well-suited
/// for opening lock files, PID files, spool files, mailboxes and other kinds
/// of files which are used for synchronisation between processes.
///
/// This trait extends [`OpenOptions`], so it can be used the following way:
/// ```no_run
/// # use flopen::OpenAndLock;
/// # use std::fs::OpenOptions;
/// let file = OpenOptions::new()
///     .read(true)
///     .write(true)
///     .create(true)
///     .open_and_lock("/path/to/file")?;
/// # Ok::<(), std::io::Error>(())
/// ```
